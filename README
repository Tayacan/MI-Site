MI-Site
This is a school project by four students at a danish Technical High School. We study math, IT and programming as well as the mandatory subjects like danish, english, physics and chemistry.

The Assignment
Last year, we created a database for a fictional business in Microsoft Access. We're now supposed to recreate that database using MySQL and of course with an interface in xhtml, PHP and JavaScript. However, those fictional businesses aren't terribly interesting, so the four of us proposed a different project - why not make a website for our study program? As you may have guessed, our teacher agreed. 

Our project
We're going to create a forum and a news site, as well as a few pages with general info about the school, the subjects and whatever else we come up with. It will be possible to edit all of it using an admin panel. It will be written in the same languages as the standard project, and it will have roughly the same functionality, but the topic will be different, and hopefully it will end up on the schools server at some point, being managed by younger generations of MI's.
